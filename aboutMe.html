        <h1>More About Me:</h1>
        <p>I'm a software engineer. All my life, I have been deeply invested in the field of computer science and programming. Having the ability to create fantastic games, programs, and apps from simple keystrokes will always continue to pull me in.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <p>In addition to that, I'm also a New Yorker who was born in Queens to two Polish immigrants. My multi-cultural status has led me to being trilingual and visiting various parts of the world.</p>
                <p>Other than programming, I also love to swim, binge TV shows on Netflix, listen to music, and play videogames with my friends.</p>
                <p>Social media wise, I don't find much fun in posting on Instagram, but I do scroll through Twitter and talk with friends on Discord.</p>
